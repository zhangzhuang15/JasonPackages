## how to access function defined in c library from rust ?

The following content is generated by AI of `cursor app`.

To call a C library from Rust, you can use the libc crate. Here are the steps to do so:

Add the libc crate as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
libc = "0.2"
```

Import the necessary items from the libc crate in your Rust code:

```rust
use libc::{c_int, c_char};
use std::ffi::CString;
use std::os::raw::c_void;
```

Declare the external C function you want to call using the extern keyword:

```rust
extern "C" {
    fn your_c_function(arg1: c_int, arg2: *const c_char) -> c_void;
}
```

Call the C function from your Rust code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let arg1 = 42;
    let arg2 = CString::new("hello").expect("CString::new failed");

    unsafe {
        your_c_function(arg1, arg2.as_ptr());
    }
}
```

Make sure to replace your_c_function with the actual name of the C function you want to call. Adjust the types of the arguments and return value accordingly.

Remember to handle any potential errors that may occur when calling the C function.

## how to mix compile Rust code and c library ?

The following content is generated by AI of `cursor app`.

To use cargo to mix compile Rust code and a C library, you can follow these steps:

- Create a new Rust project using `cargo new` command.
- Add the C library as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file.
- Write your Rust code that interacts with the C library.
- Build your project using `cargo build`.

Here's an example of how you can modify your Cargo.toml file to include a C library as a dependency:

```toml
[dependencies]
libc = "0.2"
```

In your Rust code, you can use the libc crate to interact with the C library.

Here's an example of how you can modify your code to use a C library function:

```rust
extern crate libc;

use libc::c_int;

#[link(name = "myclib")]
extern "C" {
    fn my_c_function(arg1: c_int, arg2: c_int) -> c_int;
}

fn my_rust_function(arg1: i32, arg2: i32) -> i32 {
    unsafe {
        my_c_function(arg1 as c_int, arg2 as c_int)
    }
}
```

Make sure to replace `"myclib"` with the actual name of the C library you want to use.

After making these changes, you can build your project using `cargo build`. Cargo will automatically compile both the Rust code and the C library and link them together.

## how esbuild manages its install action?

esbuild supports many platforms, e.g. macOS-darwin-arm64, linux-arm64, etc.

whatever your platform is, esbuild official website
tells you to install esbuild with `npm install esbuild`, not `npm install @esbuild/<your-platform>`.

**why does esbuild ignore the specific platform ?**

for each platform, esbuild generates corresponding package under npm/@esbuild directory, these packages will be published to npm registry separately.

for specific-platform package under npm/@esbuild directory, its package.json contains "os" "cpu" field,
this is very important!

esbuild generates install.js file (compile node-install.ts) and put it into
npm/esbuild directory, this file is the key.

esbuild publishes the package which is under npm/esbuild directory, when `npm install esbuild`, we just install this package.

in package.json under npm/esbuild directory, there is a "optionalDependencies" field, this field contains
all-platform @esbuild packages.when we're on macOS-arm64 platform, `npm install esbuild`, `npm` will walk "optionalDependencies" field, look up the
"os" "cpu" field of specific-platform @esbuild package.json, then install the corresponding package,
so we will install `@esbuild/darwin-arm64`, not `@esbuild/linux-arm64` and others.

there is a magic in esbuild package, after we install esbuild, its `install.js` will be executed, because esbuild configures this action in "postinstall" script in its package.json.

The main action described in `install.js` is just that copy /bin/esbuild of @esbuild package to /bin/esbuild of esbuild package.

if @esbuild package is installed, copy directly;

if @esbuild package is not installed:

- create temp dir under node_modules/esbuild;
- npm install @esbuild package under this temp dir;
- copy directly;
- remove temp dir recursively;

if it still doesn't work:

- download @esbuild package tar.gz from npm registry;
- unzip it;
- copy;

so, the key difference between esbuild package and other packages is:
**bin directory of the package is dynamic generated after package is installed, not generated in development before publish the package.**

what amazing design!

It inspires me to do similar thing in my package.
