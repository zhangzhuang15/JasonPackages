# `@jasonzhang/ts-project-template`

JasonZhang's pure ts project template.

### Get To Know

- only works for typescript, not including `.tsx` or something like `react`;
- use `airbnb-base` as eslint config;
- prettier config is ok, not conflicting with eslint;
- use `vscode` as IDE, use `Prettier Eslint Plugin` to format on save;
- if you just use typescript to create command line app, server app, package development, it's just your choice;
